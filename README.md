## Oahu Temperature Trends in June and December

## OVERVIEW
### Purpose:  The purpose of the current analysis is to assess temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, HI to be used as a guideline for the feasability of running a successful surf shop and ice-cream business year-round in that location.  Summary statistics for each month (June and December) will be compared and contrasted.

## RESOURCES
  - Source Date: [hawaii.sqlite](Resources\hawaii.sqlite)
  - Software: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask

## RESULTS
- Average temperature statistics were prepared for (June Temps)[Resources\June_Temps.png] and (December Temps)[Resources\December_Temps.png].
    - The average temperature in June (75°) is about 4 degrees warmer than the average temperature December (71°).
    - There is slightly more spread in the December temperatures (s.d. of 3.75° for December versus s.d. of 3.26° for June), meaning there is more variability/ less consistency in December temperatures.
    - The minimum temperatures observed in June (64°) are considerably higher than those observed in December (56°).
    - While 75% of days in June are 73° or warmer, only 50% of December days reach a temperature of 71°.

## SUMMARY
### Everything is relative.  The average temperatures for both June and December are in the 70's.  June is certainly a bit warmer on average than December, but on the surface, it seems that year-round surfing might be feasable in Oahu.  Further analysis would be useful.  For starters, it would be interesting to see how the average temperature behaves throughout each of these months.  Perhaps a histogram of the average daily temperatures would help to see if there is any normal variation within each month.  Also, average water temperature statistics would be extremely useful.  It would probably be worthwhile to analyze and plot average precipitation alongside average temperatures as well.
